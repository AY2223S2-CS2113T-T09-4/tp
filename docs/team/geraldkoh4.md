## Project: Modganiser

Modganiser is effortless module planning at your fingertips via the Command Line Interface (CLI), focused on helping
Information Security Undergraduates graduate in 4 years. It provides a platform to plan all 4 years of your modules
to ensure that you meet your graduation requirements.
Built on Java, Modganiser can definitely get your module plan up faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)
apps if you can type fast.
