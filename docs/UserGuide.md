### 4.1 Notes on the Command Format
```diff
üìì Note: 
1. Command Words
  - Command words are not case-sensitive
    Eg. BYE will be accepted as the bye command
2. Parameters
  - Words in UPPER_CASE refers to the inputs from the user
  - All inputs for the command parameters should come with a slash ‚Äú/‚Äù before it to indicate that it is a user input and not a Command Word.
  - Inputs from you are not case-sensitive. All inputs will be converted to uppercase before they are executed. Therefore, parameters like /cs2113t will be treated as /CS2113T by default
    Eg. find /CODE /Cs2113t will be treated as FIND /CODE /CS2113T by Modganiser
  - You should provide as many inputs as there are parameter fields for the command. Missing or Additional Inputs will trigger an error by Modganiser
3. Markdown Texts
  - Markdown texts are texts that look like this, which indicates that this is a command and the parameters that the user can input.
4. Errors and Warnings
  - If you are receiving an error or warning, do check that you do not have missing or additional inputs and that your inputs are in the list of accepted input
